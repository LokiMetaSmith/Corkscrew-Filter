# Project To-Do List

This file tracks planned enhancements and future work for the Thirsty Corkscrew project.

- [x] Add the ability to make different parameter configurations based on included config files.
- [ ] Refine the `CorkscrewSlitKnife` geometry to have a chamfered or ramped leading edge to improve separation efficiency.
- [ ] Conduct CFD analysis to test different design parameters (slit shape, screw pitch, etc.).
- [ ] Add particle tracking to the CFD simulation to visualize and quantify separation effectiveness.
