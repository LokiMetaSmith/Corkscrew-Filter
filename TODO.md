# Project To-Do List

This file tracks planned enhancements and future work for the Thirsty Corkscrew project.

- [x] Add the ability to make different parameter configurations based on included config files.
- [ ] Refine the `CorkscrewSlitKnife` geometry to have a chamfered or ramped leading edge to improve separation efficiency.
- [ ] Conduct CFD analysis to test different design parameters (slit shape, screw pitch, etc.).
- [ ] Add particle tracking to the CFD simulation to visualize and quantify separation effectiveness.
- [x] Document `optimizer/` and `parameters/` directories in the README. These are core functions for simulation and parameter evaluation.
- [ ] Complete refactor of barb generators into a unified, parameterized `Barb` module.
- [ ] Create `FilterHolder` part (barb fitting with dual O-rings and optional threading).
- [ ] Standardize legacy coupling configurations (Cartridge, Sandblaster) into `configs/` files.
